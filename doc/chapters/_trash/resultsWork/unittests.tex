CF: I suggest chapter 3 should be only gneral emthods
then ch4 should be "experiments and results"
    and have strucytre:
        experimment 1
        result 1
        experiment 2 
        result 2...

you need to explain in the intro signpost what you are doing this as it's conventional. It is because you are doing optimisation, which requires finding and eliminating one bottleneck at a time. This can be cnsidered a form of agile.
