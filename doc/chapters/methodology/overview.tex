As we are using test driven development in conjunction with profiling to guide the refactoring, we present our general methodology for refactoring and then each optimisation technique.
Alongside each optimisation, we provide results and analysis on what each optimisation does to the model.
Finally, we analyse the profiling and verify the model after all optimisations.
