% Hi Charles,

% This will be paragraph will be removed for the final submission, however I thought that I should let you know that most of this report has been written as "I am the expert".
% Because of this I feel it is possible to miss underpinning the argument with proper academic literature.
% If there is a claim in the Literature Review/Methodology/Project Requirements(Aims, Tools and toolsets, project management, etc.) please let me know by placing \mono{\\source} at the end of the relevant sentence.
% Likewise, if a sentence does not make sense, then please can you place \mono{\\wording} in the relevant sentence. 
% I have split sentences into individual lines to make this process easier.

% I have also included points where I am not sure on the correct approach to it, and have indicated these points in different colours.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \noteCF{Red}: Questions
%     \item \noteComment{Green}: Wording problems
%     \item \noteAttention{Blue}: extra information which might not be needed.
% \end{itemize}

% Thank you in advance,
% Jack.
